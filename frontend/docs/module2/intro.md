# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, where you'll learn to create digital twins of humanoid robots and their environments to validate control logic, physics, and interactions.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that simulates its behavior in real-time. In robotics, digital twins allow us to test control algorithms, validate physics interactions, and develop AI behaviors in a safe, repeatable environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up Gazebo simulation environments for humanoid robots
- Create realistic physics models and environments
- Integrate simulation with ROS 2 nodes from Module 1
- Validate robot control logic in simulation
- Understand the benefits of simulation-first development

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (mass, friction, collisions)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts (preferred but not required)

## Topics Covered

- Gazebo simulation environment setup
- Physics modeling and parameters
- Environment creation and customization
- Sensor integration in simulation
- Connecting simulation to ROS 2 nodes
- Validation and testing methodologies

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 3-4 weeks (depending on prior experience)

Let's begin creating digital twins that will revolutionize how you develop and test robotic systems!
