# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3, where you'll build the AI brain for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS with photorealistic simulation and synthetic data.

## Overview

The AI-Robot Brain represents the cognitive layer of robotics, where perception, reasoning, and decision-making converge. Using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, you'll develop sophisticated AI capabilities that enable robots to perceive their environment, make intelligent decisions, and execute complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic robot simulation
- Implement perception pipelines using Isaac ROS components
- Generate synthetic data for training AI models
- Develop navigation and path planning algorithms
- Integrate AI models with robot control systems
- Optimize AI inference for robotic applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Experience with Python and ROS 2
- Access to a GPU-enabled system (recommended for Isaac Sim)

## Topics Covered

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim setup and configuration
- Isaac ROS components and integration
- Perception pipelines (vision, lidar, IMU)
- Synthetic data generation techniques
- Navigation and path planning with Nav2
- Deep learning integration in robotics
- AI model optimization for edge deployment

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 4-5 weeks (depending on prior experience)

Let's build the intelligent brain that will power the next generation of autonomous robots!
