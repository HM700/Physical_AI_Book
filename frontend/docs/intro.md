# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI Book - an educational platform designed to teach you how to build AI systems that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics. It encompasses AI systems that can interact with the physical environment through sensing, reasoning, and acting. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must deal with the complexities, uncertainties, and dynamics of the real world.

## Learning Approach

Our curriculum follows a **simulation-first approach**, allowing you to learn and experiment with humanoid robots in safe, controlled environments before transitioning to real hardware. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Safety**: Experiment freely without risk of damaging expensive equipment
- **Repeatability**: Run experiments multiple times with consistent conditions
- **Speed**: Accelerate learning by running simulations faster than real-time
- **Accessibility**: Access to high-end robotics without physical hardware requirements

## The Four Modules

The Physical AI Book is organized into four progressive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the foundational middleware layer that allows AI software to control humanoid robots in simulated physical environments.

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Create digital twins of humanoid robots and their environments to validate control logic, physics, and interactions.

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Build the AI brain for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS with photorealistic simulation and synthetic data.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate LLMs, speech recognition, and cognitive planning to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks based on human instructions.

## Getting Started

Each module builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity. We recommend following the modules in order, but you can jump to specific topics if you have prior experience with the concepts covered in earlier modules.
