# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. It encompasses robotics, computer vision, manipulation, locomotion, and human-robot interaction.

### Who is the Physical AI Book for?
Our curriculum is designed for students, researchers, and professionals interested in robotics and AI. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, our progressive modules will deepen your understanding.

### Do I need physical robots to learn from this book?
No! Our simulation-first approach allows you to learn and experiment with robots in safe, virtual environments before transitioning to physical hardware.

## Technical Requirements

### What hardware do I need?
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 4+ CPU cores
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM, 8+ CPU cores, dedicated GPU (NVIDIA preferred)
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space for simulation environments

### What software do I need?
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill LTS
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Do I need an internet connection?
Yes, an internet connection is required for downloading packages, accessing cloud resources, and using the AI tutor features.

## Learning Path

### How long does it take to complete the program?
- **Module 1 (ROS 2)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Module 2 (Digital Twin)**: 3-4 weeks
- **Module 3 (AI-Robot Brain)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Module 4 (VLA)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Total**: Approximately 3-4 months for dedicated learners

### Do I need to follow the modules in order?
We strongly recommend following the modules sequentially, as each builds upon concepts from the previous ones. However, experienced practitioners may skip modules they're already familiar with.

### Will I receive a certificate?
Upon completing all modules and associated projects, you'll receive a certificate of completion.

## Simulation vs. Reality

### How closely do simulations match real robots?
Modern simulation engines like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim provide high-fidelity physics and sensor models that closely approximate real-world behavior. However, reality always has nuances that simulations don't perfectly capture.

### Can I transfer skills from simulation to real robots?
Absolutely! Simulation provides a safe, repeatable environment to develop and test algorithms before applying them to physical robots. Many robotics companies use simulation-first workflows.
