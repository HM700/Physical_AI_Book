# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, where you'll integrate LLMs, speech recognition, and cognitive planning to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks based on human instructions.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent the cutting edge of human-robot interaction, enabling robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute complex tasks. This module combines computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action execution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement Whisper voice-to-text pipeline for robot commands
- Integrate LLMs to map natural language to robotic actions
- Develop cognitive planning systems for task execution
- Create multimodal perception systems
- Build end-to-end VLA systems for complex robot behaviors
- Design intuitive human-robot interaction paradigms

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI perception
- Basic knowledge of natural language processing
- Experience with Python and AI/ML concepts

## Topics Covered

- Speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper
- Large Language Model (LLM) integration for action mapping
- Cognitive planning and task decomposition
- Vision-language models for scene understanding
- Multimodal perception and action execution
- Human-robot interaction design principles

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 4-5 weeks (depending on prior experience)

Let's build the ultimate interface between human intention and robotic action!
