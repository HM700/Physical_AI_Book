# About Physical AI Book

## Mission

The Physical AI Book is an educational platform designed to teach students and developers how to build AI systems that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Our mission is to democratize access to robotics education and accelerate innovation in the field of Physical AI.

## Philosophy

We believe in a **simulation-first approach** to robotics education. By learning with simulated robots in safe, controlled environments, students can experiment freely, iterate quickly, and build confidence before working with physical hardware.

## Our Approach

### Progressive Learning
Our curriculum is organized into four progressive modules, each building upon the previous one:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the middleware that connects AI software to robots
2. **Digital Twin** - Create simulated environments for testing and validation
3. **AI-Robot Brain** - Develop intelligent perception and decision-making
4. **Vision-Language-Action** - Enable natural human-robot interaction

### Hands-On Experience
Every concept is accompanied by practical exercises and projects that reinforce learning through doing.

### Community Driven
We foster a collaborative learning environment where students can share insights, solve problems together, and build upon each other's work.

## Technology Stack

- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System for middleware and communication
- **Gazebo/Unity**: Simulation environments for digital twins
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: Advanced simulation and AI integration
- **Docusaurus**: Documentation and learning platform
- **OpenAI**: LLMs for enhanced learning experiences
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for RAG-based learning assistance

## Target Audience

- Students pursuing robotics, AI, or computer science degrees
- Professionals transitioning into robotics
- Researchers exploring new Physical AI applications
- Educators developing robotics curricula

## Getting Involved

The Physical AI Book is an open-source project. We welcome contributions in the form of:
- Course content and improvements
- Bug reports and feature requests
- Translation to other languages
- Teaching materials and exercises

## Support
