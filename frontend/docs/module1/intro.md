# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll learn the foundational concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) - the middleware that enables AI software to communicate with and control humanoid robots in simulated environments.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms. In this module, you'll learn how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" for robots, enabling communication between different software components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement publishers and subscribers for inter-process communication
- Design message types and services for robot control
- Build basic humanoid robot models using URDF
- Control robot movement in simulation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (preferred but not required)

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 architecture and concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Message and service definitions
- Parameter management
- Launch files and lifecycle management
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Basic robot simulation in Gazebo

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 2-3 weeks (depending on prior experience)

Let's dive into the fascinating world of ROS 2 and discover how it enables the communication infrastructure for modern robotics!
